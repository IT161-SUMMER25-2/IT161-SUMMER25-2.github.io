Week 4 Update
==============
This package contains the updated `class.html` for Week 4.

What changed (Week 4 scope):
- Added a responsive student card grid (CSS grid).
- Improved accessibility (alt text, heading structure, aria labels).
- Enabled image performance via `loading="lazy"` on gallery images.
- Provided placeholder cards you can duplicate per student.

How to use:
1) Upload `class.html` to your repo root (same place as index.html and styles.css).
2) Optional: add real student photos and links by replacing placeholder content.
3) Keep filenames (case-sensitive). If `placeholder.jpg` isn't in your repo yet, either add one or remove the placeholder <img> blocks until you have real images.

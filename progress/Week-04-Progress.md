# Weeks 2–4 Progress — IT161 Static Site

**Live site:** https://it161-summer25-2.github.io/  
**Repo:** https://github.com/IT161-SUMMER25-2/IT161-SUMMER25-2.github.io

## Project Overview
Static site for IT161 demonstrating semantic HTML, simple navigation, basic styling, and image usage.

## My Role
Solo implementation — page structure, navigation, base CSS, initial images, and deployment via GitHub Pages.

## Work Completed (Weeks 2–4)
- Set up core pages: `index.html`, `about.html`, `monsters.html`, `weapons.html`, and `class.html`.
- Built a shared header/nav and footer; added active link styles with `aria-current="page"`.
- Added first-pass content and images, and verified links/paths.
- Established a consistent folder structure (e.g., `images/`) to avoid broken paths later.

## Visuals / Links
- **Homepage:** https://it161-summer25-2.github.io/
- **Monsters:** https://it161-summer25-2.github.io/monsters.html
- **Weapons:** https://it161-summer25-2.github.io/weapons.html

> (Optional) Add screenshots to your repo and embed them here, e.g.:
> `![Monsters page](images/screenshots/monsters.png)`

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Path consistency:** Ensured all image and link paths match exact filenames/case (important on GitHub Pages).
- **Navigation consistency:** Reused the same header across pages to prevent broken links.

## Key Learnings
- Organizing assets early (folders, naming) prevents 404s later.
- Small accessibility wins like `aria-current="page"` improve clarity for users and graders.
